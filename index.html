<h1>Hi! 🙋‍♂️</h1>

<p>I'm Al, and I'm a Systems Engineer at <a href="https://codeblue.co.nz" title="Codeblue">Codeblue</a> as well as a web and mobile app developer for <a href="https://twohill.nz" title="Twohill &amp; Co">Twohill &amp; Co</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of work I'm busy raising my daughter Evie 👼, and if I get a bit of spare time I like to brew 🍺and ride my Triumph 🏍.</p>

<p>My previous blog sites have been lost in the mists of time, so I figured Github pages should be around for a while, and allow me to put my musings somewhere useful.</p>
