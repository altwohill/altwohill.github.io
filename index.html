<h1>Hi! 🙋‍♂️</h1>

<p>I'm Al, and I'm a Software Architect at <a href="https://talleys.co.nz" title="Talley's">Talley's</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of work I'm busy raising my kids Evie 👼 and Charlie 👦, and if I get a bit of spare time I like to brew 🍺 and ride my Triumph 🏍.</p>

<p>My previous blog sites have been lost in the mists of time, so I figured Github pages should be around for a while, and allow me to put my musings somewhere useful.</p>

<p>Feel free to @ me <a href="https://twitter.com/altwohill" title="@altwohill on twitter">@altwohill</a></p>
